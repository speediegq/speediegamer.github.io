## ðŸ¥‡ speedie://about | Because it needs to be cool you know :)
##### I'm speedie (also known as spdgmr and speediegamer) I like tinkering with computers and doing random dumb stuff.
##### I archive Wii stuff and sometimes make stuff for a 16 year old operating system running on 13 year old Macs. (Project 081)
##### Other than that I spend most of my time playing Geometry Dash, doing dumb stuff on Discord and various other things.
